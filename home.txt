# Extrinsic Sensor Calibration - EngD ASD 2022 - Block II project

This project focused on the extrinsic calibration of TI ImRadar and Basler camera and calibrate their outputs to be used in further processing. The radar used int his project is the TIDEP-01012 imaging radar evaluation board, by Texas Instrument, along with Basler XXXXXX camera.


This is a four-chip cascade radar consisting of 4xAWR2243 MMIC transceiver with 4 Tx and 3 Rx antennas each.

This first in-house project was part of the second quartile, it took 8 weeks and was carried out by the ASD trainees of the 2022 batch.

Please find a more accurate description of the project in the [Home](https://github.com/tue-mps-edu/asd-engd-project-2022-extrinsic-sensor-calibration/wiki) wiki page.

## Setup, Configuration and Usage
Here is how you can setup the sensor and configure the proper scripts to capture some data.
### Sensor Setup
For setting the sensor up and start acquiring data with it, please refer to the first part of the [Device configuration and Data capturing by using mmWave studio](https://github.com/tue-mps-edu/asd-pdeng-project-2021-imaging-radar-integration/wiki/2.-Device-configuration-and-Data-capturing-by-using-mmWave-studio) wiki page.
This is a document that provides a simple guideline for capturing data by using mmWave-studio-2G.
### Sensor Configuration
If you want to learn more about how to configure the sensor and how to set the chirp parameters (with some theory background also), please go to the [System parameters and system configuration using LUA Scripts](https://github.com/tue-mps-edu/asd-pdeng-project-2021-imaging-radar-integration/wiki/System-parameters-and-system-configuration-using-LUA-Scripts) wiki page.
This will give you a main overview about FMCW radar sensors and chirp parameters.
### Sensor Usage
Once the sensor has been plugged, you can easily play it by following the second part of the [Device configuration and Data capturing by using mmWave studio](https://github.com/tue-mps-edu/asd-pdeng-project-2021-imaging-radar-integration/wiki/2.-Device-configuration-and-Data-capturing-by-using-mmWave-studio) wiki page.
This second part will give you hints on how to capture data using Lua scripts.



## Data Analysis
In this section everything related to data processing is presented.
### Data Visualization
You can visualize data by doing what is mentioned in the [Data visualization](https://github.com/tue-mps-edu/asd-pdeng-project-2021-imaging-radar-integration/wiki/4.-Data-visualization) wiki page.
This document outlines the basics of post-processing and data visualization of the captured data.
### 3D Point Cloud
If you want to generate the 3D point cloud of the acquired data, then refer to the [Post Processing for 3D point cloud](https://github.com/tue-mps-edu/asd-pdeng-project-2021-imaging-radar-integration/wiki/5.-Post-Processing-for-3D-point-cloud) wiki page.
This wiki page explains how to get the 3D point cloud and the heat map by using a Matlab script.
### Clustering Techniques
Refer to the [Sensor Data Analysis](https://github.com/tue-mps-edu/asd-pdeng-project-2021-imaging-radar-integration/wiki/6.-Sensor-Data-Analysis) wiki page to know something more about data transfer and processing, and clustering techniques.


## Extras
In this section you can find additional information about the project.
### Test Log
Different use-case scenarios were used during the project, based on what feature of the sensor to explore or which configuration parameter to test.
You can find all the info about the taken tests in the Excel sheet present in the main directory. The [Test log and Test plan](https://github.com/tue-mps-edu/asd-pdeng-project-2021-imaging-radar-integration/wiki/9.-Test-log-and-Test-plan) wiki page contains hints on how this document is structured.
### Point Cloud Density Increase
From the measurtement results it clearly emerged that the density of the imaging radar point cloud is quite scarse with respect to the one of the LiDAR.
Therefore, in the [Increase Point Cloud Density and Number of Frames](https://github.com/tue-mps-edu/asd-pdeng-project-2021-imaging-radar-integration/wiki/3.-Increase-Point-Cloud-Density-and-Number-of-Frames) wiki page you can find some suggestions on how to do it.
### Sensor Technology Comparison and Benchmarking Analysis
Thanks to this project, it was possible to perform a benchmarking analysis about the main setection sensors used on a vehicle. The results of this investigation are highlighted in the [Sensor Technologies Comparison](https://github.com/tue-mps-edu/asd-pdeng-project-2021-imaging-radar-integration/wiki/4.-Sensor-Technologies-Comparison) and in the [Benchmarking Results](https://github.com/tue-mps-edu/asd-pdeng-project-2021-imaging-radar-integration/wiki/3.1-Benchmarking-Results) wiki pages.
### Sensor Integration
Finally, a strategy for sensor integration within the AV of the Automotive Lab of the university is proposed in the [Sensor Integration](https://github.com/tue-mps-edu/asd-pdeng-project-2021-imaging-radar-integration/wiki/3.2-Sensor-Integration) wiki page.

## Project Status
The project is complete: the 6 weeks of time scheduled for the first in-house project of the ASD program are over.


## Possible Improvements and TODOs
Here is a list of possible improvements for the project and TODOs:
- live streaming of data: live streaming is still not possible, so a further investigation about its feasibility is needed;
- data transfer: data transfer is still quite slow, so it could be a strong improvement to the project to find alternative or better ways of transfering data, if there are any;
- AV integration: automatixe the data capturing and transfering so that it is possible to do it inside the AV without going through mmWaveStudio.

## Acknowledgments
Apart from team effort, the work carried out and the results achieved during this project were possible thanks to the technical guidance of the MPSlab, the valuable feedback provided by TI engineers, and the precious comments made by the main stakeholder, dr. Pavol Jancura, who steered the project in the direction it took during the weeks.
